Tasks:
			1. Move zeros to the end of vector.
   
			2. Determine whether s1 is a substring or a permutation within s2.
   
			3. Change bit of number by index.
   
			4. Sum of numbers using bitwise operations.
   
			5. Convert sorted vector to binary tree.
   
			6. You are given a deck of cards with points and a number k, representing the number of moves.
